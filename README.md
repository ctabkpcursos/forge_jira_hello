# Forge Hello no Jira

Test Forge app written in Javascript that displays `Hello World!` in a Jira issue panel.
See Developer Forge for documentation and tutorials explaining Forge.


### Notes
- For personal/study use!
- Use the `forge deploy` command when you want to persist code changes.
- Use the `forge install` command when you want to install the app on a new site.
- Once the app is installed on a site, the site picks up the new app changes you deploy without needing to rerun the install command.
